<h2>Final project for ITF Manual Testing Course</h2>

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application.

Application under test: https://www.globalsqa.com/angularJs-protractor/BankingProject/#/login

API Documentation: https://airportgap.dev-tester.com/docs

The final project will be split into 2 sections: Testing section and SQL section.

Tools used: JIRA, Zephyr Squad, Postman, MySQL Workbench.

<h2>Functional specifications</h2>

The below Story was created in JIRA and describes the functional specifications of the Customer Login and Bank Manager Login module, for which the final project is performed upon.

<h2>1 Testing section</h2>
<h4>1.1 Test Planning</h4>

<h4>1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated</h4>
<p>Project manager - Hochdorfer Nora<br>
Product owner - Hochdorfer Nora<br>
Software developer - Hochdorfer Nora<br>
QA Engineer - Hochdorfer Nora<br>

<h4>1.1.2 Entry criteria defined</h4>
<p>-functional specifications are defined<br>
-roles needed for the project are allocated<br>
-initial project risks were detected and mitigated<br>

<h4>1.1.3 Exit criteria defined</h4>
<p>- number of unresolved bugs is insignificant or they have low priority<br>
- all tests have been executed<br>
- all resolved bugs have been re-tested and approved by the QA team<br>

Unsecured Wi-Fi and data networks<br>
  
<h4>Product risks:</h4>
Validation constraints on the fields might be too easy to the end-user<br>
Insufficient staff

<h4>1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria</h4>
<p>The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been partially achieved and the test process can continue.</p>

<h2>1.2 Test Monitoring and Control</h2>
<p>Various periodic reports were generated to reflect the current status of the testing process, in case of major problems control measures could be taken. The following status report was generated after 36.36% of the test cases were executed, on 12th of March 2023:<br>
